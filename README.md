### IEEE PRoject1 : Cryptography Communication System

IEEE Research paper and Final Year Project on Cryptography Communication Security.

### ABSTRACT 

The Cryptography is gotten from a Greek word which implies the craft of ensuring data by changing it into a muddled organization and unreadable format. It is a mix of arithmetic and software engineering. The dynamite growth of the Internet has made an expanded familiarity with intrigue uncertainty issues. Even though security is the measure worries over the internet, numerous applications have been created and structured without considering fundamental destinations of data security that is confidentiality, authentication, and protection. As our day by day exercises become increasingly more dependent upon data networks, the significance of an understanding of such security issues and trouble will also increase. To forestall some undesirable clients or individuals to gain admittance to the data, cryptography is required. .This paper introduces a new hybrid security cipher by combining the two most important Ciphers such as Polybius Cipher and Vigen√®re Cipher. This hybrid encryption cipher provides greater security as compared to classic ciphers.

### Research Paper Project2: Flower species Detection Project

### Abstract
Machine Learning is a field of computer science pro-vides the ability to learn without programming and the program explicitly. Supervised Machine Learning (SML) is the search for algorithms that reason from externally supplied instances to produce general hy-potheses, which then make predictions about future in-stances. Classification and Regression is a supervised learning in which the response is categorical that is its values are in finite Discrete and continuous set. To sim-ply the problem of classification, scikit learn tools has been used. This paper focuses on IRIS flower classifica-tion using Machine Learning with scikit tools. In this paper we will train the machine learning model with the given Iris Dataset and Analysis the performance and accuracy of Iris with Supervised Learning Algo-rithms.

Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.

**Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -**

-Dicision tree classifier
-K nearest classifier
-SVM
-Logistic Regression
-metrics
-train_test_split: We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ) My Codes, thinking, analytics and logic for making this prediction is unmatchable and best !!
